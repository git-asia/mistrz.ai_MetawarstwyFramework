# Metawarstwy Framework Repository

Welcome to the Metawarstwy Framework Repository! This repository contains two folders: `Exercise_3` and `explainTaskFromClient`. These folders contain two tasks that are closely related to creating the best prompts using Przemek Jóźwiakowski's proprietary framework - Metawarstwy.

## About the Metawarstwy Framework

- **Metawarstwy** is a mental framework.
- It is open source.
- It is designed to organize prompts effectively.
- It helps in creating prompts according to specific guidelines.
- It assists in building a clear picture of reality.

## Problem Statement

The problem we aim to solve is the lack of understanding within the technical team when it comes to tasks written by the client in Jira.

## Solution

Our solution is delivered in the form of a JSON object with a precisely defined structure.

## Folder Structure

- `Exercise_3`: This folder contains the task related to describing the client's task.
- `explainTaskFromClient`: This folder contains the task related to explaining the client's task and writing it in more technical manner.

The folders also include sample model responses.


## Usage

To use the Metawarstwy Framework and solve the problem, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the [OpenAI Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground).

2. Set the following parameters:
   - **Model:** gpt-3.5-turbo-16k
   - **Temperature:** 0.7
   - **Maximum Length:** 4000

3. The prompt for using the framework is provided in the `prompt_body.md` file, which contains two main sections: 'System' and 'User'. Place these sections in their respective dedicated places within the OpenAI Playground.

4. Submit your settings and play with the results generated by the Metawarstwy Framework.

Feel free to adjust the parameters and prompts as needed for your specific use case. Happy experimenting with the framework!
