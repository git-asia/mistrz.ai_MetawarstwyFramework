# Metawarstwy Framework Repository

Welcome to the Metawarstwy Framework Repository! This repository contains folders with Exercises and with Challenge. 
These folders contain simple examples of use cases of Przemek J√≥≈∫wiakowski's proprietary framework - Metawarstwy.

## About the Metawarstwy Framework

- **Metawarstwy** is a mental framework.
- It is open source.
- It is designed to organize prompts effectively.
- It helps in creating prompts according to specific guidelines.
- It assists in building a clear picture of reality.

## Problem Statement

There are several problems to solve:
Exercise 2: Helping out  in the acquisition of knowledge (e.g., learning a new technology, language, skill) by a person unaware of the complexity of this task.
Exercise 3 and Chellange: The problem we aim to solve is the lack of understanding within the technical team when it comes to tasks written by the client in Jira.

## Solution

The solutions can be delivered in various formats. One of presented here will be simple plain text and the other a JSON object with a precisely defined structure.

## Folder Structure

Folders contains files with excercise description, prompt body and sample answers by gpt.

## Usage

To use the Metawarstwy Framework and solve the problem, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the [OpenAI Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground).

2. Set the following parameters:
   - **Model:** gpt-3.5-turbo-16k
   - **Temperature:** 0.7
   - **Maximum Length:** 4000

3. The prompt for using the framework is provided in the `prompt_body.md` file, which contains two main sections: 'System' and 'User'. Place these sections in their respective dedicated places within the OpenAI Playground.

4. Submit your settings and play with the results generated by the Metawarstwy Framework.

Feel free to adjust the parameters and prompts as needed for your specific use case. Happy experimenting with the framework!

**Pro Tip:** If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can use the "Open Preview" option to view styled Markdown files. The 'prompl_body.md' in 'Challenge...' directory is nicely coloured üòÅ
